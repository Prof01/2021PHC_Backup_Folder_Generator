        STEPS

        1. Extract 2021PHC_KUMBUNGU DISTRICT DATA_BACKUP folder on your Desktop or your prefered location.

        2. Open the 2021PHC_KUMBUNGU DISTRICT DATA_BACKUP folder and you will see the various SAs Folders.

        3. Under each SA folder you will see the various EAs Folders (eg. EA004_(EnumName)_01) and Supervisor Backup Folder (SUP_(SupName)).

        4. Rename Each EA Backup Folder with the Enumerator Name on that EA by Replacing (EnumName) with the Enumerator Name. (eg. EA004_MOHAMMED HAJARA_01)

        5. Rename the Supervisor Backup Folder under Each SA by Replacing (SupName) with the Supervisor Name. (eg. SUP_ERIC ATIM)

        NOTE the following: 
        1. Backup Folders are Generated for Support Enumerators, you have to do that manually.

        2. Delete Extra Folders, if EAs under an SA are not up to seven(7).
